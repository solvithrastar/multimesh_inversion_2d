# multimesh_inversion_2d

The publicly available part of a code used to generate results in a manuscript submitted to Geophysical Journal International in July 2019.
_Accelerating numerical wave propagation by wavefield adapted meshes, Part II: Full-waveform inversion_

The notebook does not work at this stage since it needs additional codes which can unfortunately not be made public at this point in time.
