# multimesh_inversion_2d

The publicly available part of a code used to generate results in a manuscript submitted to Geophysical Journal International in July 2019.
_Accelerating numerical wave propagation by wavefield adapted meshes, Part II: Full-waveform inversion_

The notebook does not work out of the box but should contain everything needed to setup an environment from which it works.

A link containing a global wavefield adapted mesh assuming a source underneath the North Pole can be found [here](https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/TP2H2L8CXGnsOrE)
